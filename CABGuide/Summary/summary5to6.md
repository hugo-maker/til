## Naming Variables

- Begin a variable name with a letter of the alphabet
- Don't begin a variable name with an underscore
- Don't use a space, special character like (,)
- Dont't name a variable with the same name as a function or a command

## Character Arrays

- An array is nothing more than a list of variables of the same data type
- Reserve enough array elements to hold the longest string you will ever store in that array
- You can assign a string to a array with equals sign only at the time you define the string
- strcpy(array,"string"); Puts new string in the array
- Subscripts of array begin at 0, not 1
