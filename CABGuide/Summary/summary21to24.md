# Summary of Chapter 21 to 24

## Array

- Use for loop if you want to "step through" every array element, like initialize, printf, or change its elements
- Before you use an array, you must initialize it with value

## Sequential Search

- sequential search: based on a key 
- key: it is a value that the user enters
- parallel arrays: one array(key array) holds the key and other arrays supply needed data (key array and the oher arrays are corresponding)

## Bubble Sort

- ascending sort: low to high
- descending sort: high to low
- To use bubble sort, you need to use nested for loop
- Bubble sort requires third temporary variable to hold the in-between value when swapping the values of two variables

## Pointer

- Use the \* to define a pointer variable and to dereference a pointer variable
- Use the & to produce the address of a variable
- Don't try to make a pointer variable of one data type point to a variable of a different data type
- Don't forget to use \* when dereferencing your pointer, or you will get the wrong value
