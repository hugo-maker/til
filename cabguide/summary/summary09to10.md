# Summary of Chapter9 to 10

## Operators

- sign(-) If you want to subtract a nagative value, be sure to put a space between the minus signs like this: value = old - -new;
- You can only use % between integer data types
- Use multiple assignment operators if you have several variables to initialize

## Compound assignment operators

- Use compound assginment operators when updating variable values
- The compound operators have low priority in the table and are done after almost every other operator finishes

## Typecast

- Don't use a typecast with a variable on a line by itself
- Don't mix data type or typecast data so that it is all the same type before evaluating it
